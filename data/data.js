    I want to give
    I've been a miner for a heart of gold
    It's these expressions
    I never give
    That keep me searching for a heart of gold
    
    And I'm getting old
    Keep me searching for a heart of gold
    And I'm getting old
    
    I've been to Hollywood
    I've been to Redwood
    I crossed the ocean for a heart of gold
    I've been in my mind
    It's such a fine line
    That keeps me searching for a heart of gold
    
    And I'm getting old
    Keeps me searching for a heart of gold
    And I'm getting old
    
    Keep me searching for a heart of gold
    You keep me searching and I'm growing old
    Keep me searching for a heart of gold
    I've been a miner for a heart of gold`,
